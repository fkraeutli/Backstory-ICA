It is true that in the early years AIDS spread quickly through gay communities and that a majority of early sufferers were gay men, but this is in part due to the fact that birth control was unnecessary with same-sex partners so gay men were unlikely to use condoms, now considered one of the best ways (other than abstinence) to prevent the spread of HIV.",

Many religious groups, most visibly the Catholic Church, have opposed the use of condoms on religious grounds, and have sometimes seen condom promotion as an affront to the promotion of marriage, monogamy and sexual morality. This attitude has been encountered, most distressingly, among many learned health care providers and policy makers from sub-saharan African nations, where HIV and AIDS infection rates are horrific. Their atitude is that the distribution of condoms is in effect \"telling young people to go have sex\" and sending the wrong message to uninfected individuals. There has been no evidence to date, however, that a person who would not have normally engaged in sexual intercourse in a promiscuous fashion will now adopt a promiscuous lifestyle because they have been given a condom; or that given the massive social and media pressure, even in developing nations, for young people to have sex (let alone their own biology and hormones), that a small piece of latex will substantially increase sexual urges or desire for sexual activity... However, Pope Benedict XVI commisioned a report on whether it might be acceptable for Catholics to use condoms in to protect life inside a marriage when one partner is infected with HIV, or is sick with AIDS.",

The approach of these groups has been to promote absolute celibacy for infected individuals, monogamy within indissolvable marriage, and abstinance outside of marriage, thus creating no risk of infection so long as individuals keep to these tennents. Many such groups consider proptection-based methods, in addition to being objectionable on religious grounds, expose all persons to a small, calculable, risk, which is removed enirely by taking an abstinence-based approach. This attitude is found among some health care providers and policy makers in sub-saharan African nations, where HIV and AIDS prevalence is extremely high. Critics, however, have argued that this approach fails to properly take account of human nature (which is, they argue, instinctively opposed to absitnence), of the increased risk of lapse, and excludes a much easier and usually effective method of preventing infection.",

    "p3": "Everyone ought to be tremendously alarmed by the escalating rate of HIV infected people in the world. What is even scarier is an overwhelming percentage of that group is participating unprotected sexual intercourse. It's a known fact that HIV is a sexually transmitted disease; therefore, having unshielded relations means a boost in the statistical of HIV infected victims. The authors particularly concentrated on an area in the world that is crying for our help. The country, Zambia, with a population of 9 millions, have 45% of the childbearing women in cities where adults have HIV virus. In the capital, about 20% of the inhabitants are identified as discordant couples meaning one HIV positive and one HIV negative partner. About a quarter of the Africans, who do not know whether they are infected or not, are exposing themselves to un<em>safe</em> <em>sex</em>. The current transmission rate is about 1/500 to 1/1000.All couples, especially those discordant couples, are advised to attend what the authors refer to as VCT. VCT means voluntary HIV counseling and testing. Here they can learn valuable life guarding information.",

					<h1>Backstory: 13 years of HIV/AIDS on Wikipedia</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<p>ICA observes the 25th Day With(out) Art, taking place on World AIDS Day, December 1, 2014, with a new web-based commission by <a href="http://research.kraeutli.com">Florian Kräutli</a></p>

					<p>BackStory: 13 years of HIV/AIDS on Wikipedia is an online visualization tool which allows viewers to explore a subjective, contested, and constantly expanding history of HIV/AIDS, through a chronology of revisions to Wikipedia articles on this topic.</p>

<p>Between 12:01 a.m. and 11:59 p.m. on World AIDS Day, BackStory: 13 years of HIV/AIDS on Wikipedia will occupy the home page of ICA’s website, compelling visitors to engage viscerally in memory and loss in an ever-evolving narrative of this social crisis. After this twenty-four hour observation of Day With(out) Art, BackStory: 13 years of HIV/AIDS on Wikipedia will remain on a separate page on ICA’s website until February 1, 2015.</p>

Organized by Becky Huff Hunter, Communications Associate, with Other Means.</p>
